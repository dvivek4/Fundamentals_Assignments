  <b>ACADGILD</b> is a technology education startup, that aims to create an ecosystem for skill
development in which people can learn from mentors and from each other. <br/>We believe
that software development requires highly specialized skills that are best learned with
guidance from experienced practitioners.<br/> Online videos or classroom formats are poor
substitutes for building real projects with help from a dedicated mentor. <br/>Our mission is
to teach hands-on, job-ready software programming skills, globally, in small batches of 8
to 10 students, using industry experts.<br/>For more information please visit: <a href='https://acadgild.com' target='_blank'>https://acadgild.com</a></p>
